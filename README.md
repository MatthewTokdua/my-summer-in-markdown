# My Summer
## Introduction
My name is Matthew Tokuda, I am in 10th grade, and here's a little bit about my summer.

## Summer Travel Experiences
Over the summer, I went to San Diego with my family. While at San Diego, we visited places such as [**Sea World**](https://seaworld.com/san-diego/) and the [**Air and Space Museum**](https://sandiegoairandspace.org/).

## Favorite Movie
During summer break, I watched a couple of different movies. But the best movie that I watched over the summer was definitely [**Despicable Me 4**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Despicable_Me_4). I thought that it was a really good movie, mostly becuase the jokes were funny and I liked the minions.


## Summer Playlist
I listened to a lot of different music while I was on summer break, the entire list of the songs I listened to is linked below. Most of the music that I listen to is breakcore (lots of loud noises), or OSTs from video games, animes, and TV shows.

## Physical Activities
Some physical activities that I participated in over the summer break was going to the gym and playing baseball. For pretty much the entire summer break, I was going to the gym with a few of my friends. For a smaller amount of time, but still significant amount of time, I was playing baseball with my team and going to tournaments.
